#Question 1

Explore the dataset to calculate descriptive statistics. Do exploratory visualization to better understand the dataset.

```{r}
bikes$age <- 2016-bikes$birth.year
summary(bikes$age) #not sure how to remove na's

#separating ages into different groups, specified in comments above
age1 <- subset(bikes, age <= 20) #1190 observations
age2 <- subset(bikes, age >= 21 & age <= 30) #26185 observations
age3 <- subset(bikes, age >= 31 & age <= 40) #28984 observations
age4 <- subset(bikes, age >= 41 & age <= 50) #17732 observations
age5 <- subset(bikes, age >= 51 & age <= 60) #11626 observations

age8 <- subset(bikes, age >= 81) #48 observations, some of these ages are reaaaaally large though, max age is 131...

#SOME PEOPLE RETURN THEIR BIKES TO THE SAME PLACE THEY BORROWED THE BIKE FROM SO THE DISTANCE IS 0 - NO WAY TO CALCULATE

#convert starttime and stoptime into POSITwhatever 
#take the difference between the two to find the total time on the citibike

#john = github guy
#this project will be graded out of github repo

#make a separate rmd file that makes a sample csv (5% or something), and then at the end 
#assume that what happens in the 5% will hold for the 100%
#finish the project by EoD friday!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and then use saturday/sunday to write up the report
#good project is the project that goes deep into interpreting what the data means
#subscribers = native, no = tourists
#look at how people behave with weather data
#do different age groups behave differently with weather?

```


#Question 2

Identify patterns in the ride history data. Explain/illustrate these patterns using appropriate visualization.

```{r}




```


#Question 3

Assymetric Traffic: Stations running out of bikes because of assymetric traffic (arrivals and departures are not equal) is a big problem. Client would want to know which stations are candidates for increasing bike storage capacity. Client would like to see these stations on a map based visualization.

#Question 4

Impact of Weather. Client wants to know the impact of weather (temperature, rain, snow, wind) on the CitiBike system. 
```{r}
#linear regression, tempearture as y, behavior as x
